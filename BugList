A list of known bugs by the developers.

Most area's show up as "City"
Very buggy creature AI system.
Very buggy Combat system.  One get me by, after you cast a spell, you can click off the enemy and back on to resume
melee, otherwise you just stand there in combat stance.
Could NOT loot a game object. (Tried to loot Solanian's Journal) Goes through the opening bar then nothing.
Quest log shows slain #/# for all quests, like collect 8 quest items shows as slain 0/8, although the quest
will complete and allow turn in if you collect all the objects.
Only LAN Networking is supported at the moment.
